# Flutter Workshop

This repo is a place to store all of the add-ons, plug-ins, and helpful code that I've written to make Flutter programming easier.

## Skeleton Code

By clicking [here](my_skeleton#readme), you can view skeleton or starter code for a new Flutter project.

## Plug-Ins

By clicking [here](plugins#readme), you can view the plug-ins I've made and learn how to use them.

## Add-Ons

By clicking [here](addons#readme), you can view and download add-ons I've made and learn how to use them.

Add-ons are basically plug-ins that either aren't finished yet, didn't need to be finished, or aren't high enough quality to be on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/) (external link). They are just files to add to your project manually.
